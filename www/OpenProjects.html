<h1>Open VMKit Projects</h1>

<p>Here are a few tasks that are available for newcomers to work on, depending
on what your interests are. This list is provided to generate ideas, it is not
intended to be comprehensive. Please ask on llvm-dev for more specifics. </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Port MMTk to LLVM</b>:
MMTk is JikesRVM's Garbage Collection framework (http://jikesrvm.org) and
contains a number of GC implementations that should be independent of the VM.
MMTk is written in Java, so it is not straightforward to link it with LLVM.
Fortunately, VMKit recently started support of an ahead of time compiler for
Java and should be able to compile MMTk to a .ll file and link with C/C++
projects.
</li>

<li><b>Support copying collectors in VMKit</b>: 
VMKit currently has support for conservative GCs (Boehm and Mmap2) which do not
cooperate with the compiler and thus do not know if a value in the stack is a
pointer or not. If we want to support copying collectors we need to use LLVM's
API on garbage collection (http://llvm.org/docs/GarbageCollection.html) and
modify VMKit's codebase to track uses of GC objects.</li>

<li><b>Port VMKit's JVM to Harmony or OpenJDK</b>:
VMKit currently uses GNU Classpath for the standard Java classes. Interfacing
with another library such as Apache Harmony (http://harmony.apache.org) or
Sun's OpenJDK (http://openjdk.java.net) may help improving support for latest
benchmarks (http://www.spec.org/jvm2008).</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the LLVM side, here are a few interesting projects that would help VMKit:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Adaptive Optimization System</b>:
Being able to adaptively optimize JIT-compiled code would dramastically help
the startup time of VMKit. All the non-adaptive bits are already there in LLVM:
baseline compiler (with the -fast command line and the simple register
allocator), optimized compiler (with the linear scan register allocator), and
a full set of optimizations changeable at runtime. What's left is a system that
dynamically lookup the hotness of methods and re-compile with optimizations the
methods that are often executed.
</li>

<li><b>Type-based alias-analysis</b>:
Safe languages such as ones supported by VMKit (Java, C#) benefit a lot from
a type based alias analysis. LLVM currently lacks full support of this feature
for safe languages.
</li>

<li><b>Misceallenous Java-related optimizations</b>:
Removal of array bounds checks, null pointer checks, devirtualization,
inlining, etc.
</li>
</ul>
