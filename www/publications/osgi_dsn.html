<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
The OSGi framework is a Java-based, centralized, component oriented
platform. It is being widely adopted as an execution environment for 
the development of extensible applications. However, current Java
Virtual Machines are unable to isolate components from each other.
For instance, a malicious component can freeze the complete platform
by allocating too much memory or alter the behavior of other components by
modifying shared variables.

This paper presents I-JVM, a Java Virtual Machine that provides a
lightweight approach to isolation while preserving compatibility with
legacy OSGi applications. Our evaluation of I-JVM shows that it solves
the 8 known OSGi vulnerabilities that are due to the Java Virtual
Machine and that the overhead of I-JVM compared to the JVM on which
it is based is below 20%.
