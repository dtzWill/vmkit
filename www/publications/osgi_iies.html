<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
The Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) specification defines a dynamic Java-based service oriented architecture for networked environments such
as home service gateways. To provide isolation between different services, it relies on the Java class loading mechanism.
While class loaders have many advantages beside isolation, they are poor in protecting the system against
malicious or buggy services. In this paper,
we propose a new approach for service isolation. It is based on the Java isolate technology, without a
task-oriented architecture. Our approach is more tailored to service-oriented architectures and in particular
offers a complete isolation abstraction to the OSGi platform. It is currently under development, hence
we do not provide in this paper any technical details nor results.
